# AmuCharts V4 Backup

This backup was created before adding the Diagnosis Profile view to the AmuCharts component.

The current AmuCharts.tsx includes:
- Prevalence view with comprehensive charts
- ATC4 Profile view with Overall ATC4 Class Distribution donut chart
- AWaRe Profile view with classification charts  
- Indication Profile view with indication breakdowns
- Prophylaxis view with prophylaxis-specific charts
- Rx Quality view with quality indicators and radar chart with 80% targets

This version does not include the Diagnosis Profile view that is being added next.

To restore this version:
1. Copy the current /components/AmuCharts.tsx content to this backup
2. Replace /components/AmuCharts.tsx with the previous version if needed
