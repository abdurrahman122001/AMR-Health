## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Import Paths**: When restoring backups, update import paths to remove the `../` prefix for relative imports.

2. **Asset Dependencies**: The App structure backup includes Figma asset imports that must be maintained.

3. **State Management**: The navigation state (`activeDashboard`) is managed at the App level and passed down to components.

4. **Styling Consistency**: All components use the established design system with consistent spacing, colors, and typography.

5. **Responsive Design**: All backed-up components maintain responsive design principles for various screen sizes.

## 🔄 Restoration Priority:

If you need to restore the working application quickly:

1. **First**: Restore `AppStructureBackup.tsx` to `/App.tsx`
2. **Second**: Restore `NavigationBackup.tsx` to `/components/Navigation.tsx` 
3. **Third**: Restore summary cards if they were modified
4. **Fourth**: Create individual dashboard components if needed

This ensures the core navigation and structure are functional immediately.
